This webapp saves your created notes locally, which means the notes will be saved in the browser and not on the cloud. It is for that reason you don't have to worry about creating accounts or anything complicated, enjoy the webapp and keep yourself organized.

## Overview

# Main Screen

When you first get in the webapp you see a blank screen, that's because you still haven't created any notes. In order to change that press the "Create" button on the top of the webapp to access the creator screen.
